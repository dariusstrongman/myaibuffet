## Implementation
To use the optimized CSS file:

   cp assets/css/main.css assets/css/main.css.backup
   ```

2. **Replace with optimized version:**
   ```bash
   cp assets/css/main.optimized.css assets/css/main.css
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly:** Verify all pages render correctly

4. **Monitor performance:** Use browser dev tools to confirm improvements

## Recommendations for Further Optimization
1. **Critical CSS:** Extract above-the-fold CSS for inline inclusion
2. **Code splitting:** Separate page-specific CSS if more pages are added
3. **CSS minification:** Apply additional minification for production
4. **Tree shaking:** Implement automated unused CSS removal in build process
5. **Modern CSS:** Consider using CSS container queries for more efficient responsive design

## Conclusion
The optimization successfully reduced the CSS file size by 78% while maintaining all functionality. The website should now load significantly faster, especially on mobile devices and slower connections. All essential visual design elements, interactions, and responsive behavior have been preserved.
